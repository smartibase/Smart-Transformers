        padding constraints, such as enforcing divisibility by a specific integer (e.g., FPN) or padding to a square
        (e.g., ViTDet with large-scale jitter in :paper:vitdet). `padding_constraints` contains these optional items

        `square_size` > 0.

        TODO: use type of Dict[str, int] to avoid torchscipt issues. The type of padding_constraints could be
        generalized as TypedDict (Python 3.8+) to support more types in the future.
